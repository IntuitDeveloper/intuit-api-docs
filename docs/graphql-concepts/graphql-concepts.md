# Learn about GraphQL

Intuit Ecosystem API uses the [GraphQL API framework](https://graphql.org). Here's a brief overview. 

## What's GraphQL?

GraphQL is an API query language that simplifies client-side requests. Apps can do a lot with a single query. You can can query data across multiple resources, ask for data in a specific format, or get the server to perform several operations. 

All queries go to a single endpoint on the server. The server parses queries and only returns the specific requested data in the requested format.

### Learn GraphQL concepts 

- [Make queries to fetch data from the server](https://intuitdeveloper.github.io/intuit-api-docs/docs/graphql-concepts/query/)
- [Use mutations to modify data](https://intuitdeveloper.github.io/intuit-api-docs/docs/graphql-concepts/mutation/)
- [Use introspection to get the schema](https://intuitdeveloper.github.io/intuit-api-docs/docs/graphql-concepts/introspection/)
- [Use variables to simplify queries](https://intuitdeveloper.github.io/intuit-api-docs/docs/graphql-concepts/other-concepts/)
- [Use fragments to reuse sets of fields](https://intuitdeveloper.github.io/intuit-api-docs/docs/graphql-concepts/other-concepts/)
- [Use directives to conditionally control return data](https://intuitdeveloper.github.io/intuit-api-docs/docs/graphql-concepts/other-concepts/)
- [Use pagination to get data subsets](https://intuitdeveloper.github.io/intuit-api-docs/docs/graphql-concepts/other-concepts/)
