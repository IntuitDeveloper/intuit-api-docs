# Learn about GraphQL

Intuit Ecosystem API uses the [GraphQL API framework](https://graphql.org/). Here's a brief overview.

## What's GraphQL?

GraphQL is an API query language that simplifies client-side requests. Apps can do a lot of work with just a single query: it can query multiple resources and entities, request data in a specific format, or get the server to perform several operations. 

> “At its simplest, GraphQL is about asking for specific fields on objects.” [GraphQL.org](https://graphql.org){:target="_blank"}]

All queries go to a single endpoint on the server. The server parses queries and only returns the requested data in the requested format.
