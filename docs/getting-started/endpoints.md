# Get the latest endpoint for Intuit Ecosystem API

Endpoints are the locations on our server where apps send requests to call APIs.

Since Intuit Ecosystem API is based on  GraphQL, there's only one endpoint. No matter which entities or fields you include in your queries, requests all go to the same endpoint.
