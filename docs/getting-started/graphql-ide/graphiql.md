# Set up and test with GraphiQL 

GraphiQL is one of many GraphQL IDEs you can use for testing. It's a lightweight option built on React.

## Step 1: Set up your app in the Intuit Developer Portal

If you haven't already, [get a QuickBooks Online sandbox company](../authentication/) for testing, [create your app](../authentication/), and get your sandbox company's [**Client ID** and **Client Secret**](../authentication/).

## Step 2: Download GraphiQL

Go to GitHub to [download and install GraphiQL](https://github.com/skevy/graphiql-app).

## Step 3: Set up OAuth2.0
[Set up OAuth 2.0](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization) for your app to get access tokens for GraphiQL.

You're now ready to test queries in GraphiQL.
