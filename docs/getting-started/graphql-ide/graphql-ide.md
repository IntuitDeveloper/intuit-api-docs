## Testing queries using a GraphQL IDE

Use a GraphQL Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) to test and validate queries during development.

There are a couple GraphQL IDEs we recommend for Intuit Ecosystem API: Insomnia and GraphiQL. In particular, we prefer Insomnia for it's collection and built-in authorization features. Here's how to set up and use IDEs to test queries. 

* [Set up and test with Insomnia](./insomnia/)
* [Set up and test with GraphiQL](./graphiql/)
