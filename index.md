# Welcome to Intuit Ecosystem API

Intuit Ecosystem API is our newest platform. It utilizes the [GraphQL framework](https://graphql.org/) and makes developing focused solutions around specific accounting problems easier than ever.

Intuit Ecosystem API offers several advantages over our existing [REST-based QuickBooks Online Accounting API](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/rest-api-features). In general, this new paradigm is more dynamic, requires fewer queries, and allows granular data scoping.

## Get Started

The below tracks can help you get started using Intuit's Ecosystem API:

- [Set up and start developing](./docs/getting-started)

**Note**: Intuit Ecosystem API is currently in alpha. Paritcipation is by invite-only for Intuit partners.
